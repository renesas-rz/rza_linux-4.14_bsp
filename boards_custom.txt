#
# Edit this file in order to add build support for your board.
# This file assumes you have already used the add_new_board.sh scripts in u-boot and kernel.
# See the BSP Porting Guide for more details.
#
# Note that board name must be the same for both u-boot and kernel.
#
# For example, if you used the name "rztoaster", we will assume the follow
# files exist for your board:
#
# u-boot default configuration
#   u-boot-2017.05/configs/rztoaster_defconfig
#
# Kernel default configuration (uImage)
#  linux-4.9/arch/arm/configs/rztoaster_defconfig
#
# XIP Kernel default configuration (xipImage)
#  linux-4.9/arch/arm/configs/rztoaster_xip_defconfig
#
# Device Tree
#   linux-4.9/arch/arm/boot/dts/r7s72100-rztoaster.dts
#
#
# Steps to add a new board:
#
# 1. Add the name of your board (lower case) to CUSTOM_BOARDS
#    Separate each board with a space. For example: CUSTOM_BOARDS = "rzdog rzcat rztoaster"
#
# 2. Copy the TEMPLATE below and replace "xxxx" on each line with your board name. Remember to
#    remove the '#' from the beginning of each line.
#
#    You can refer to the 'boards_renesas.txt' file for examples, but do not edit that file.
#

### TEMPLATE TO COPY ###
# xxxx
#   BRD_DESC_xxxx="My board"    # A simple description of your board. Only use letters and numbers.
#  BRD_DLRAM_xxxx=0x0C000000    # Download RAM address: The beginning of external SDRAM. If no SDRAM, then beginning of internal RAM.
#  BRD_UBOOT_xxxx=0x18000000    # u-boot Flash address: The address of u-boot in Flash (basically always 0x18000000)
#    BRD_DTB_xxxx=0x180C0000    # Device Tree Blob Flash address: The address of dtb file in Flash.
# BRD_KERNEL_xxxx=0x18200000    # Kernel Flash address: The address of the kernel (uImage or xipImage) in Flash
# BRD_ROOTFS_xxxx=0x18800000    # Root File System address in flash: The address of your rootfs.
#   BRD_QSPI_xxxx=DUAL          # Either "SINGLE" or "DUAL" QSPI flash. If "DUAL", this assumes only kernel and rootfs are stored in dual flash.
