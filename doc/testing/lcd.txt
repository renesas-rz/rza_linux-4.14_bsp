        Board HW: LCD Panel that comes with the RSK
             Bus: VDC5 ch0


NOTES:
Requires .config to have
	CONFIG_FB=y
	CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE=y

Also, enabling "CONFIG_LOGO=y" adds the penguin image at the top during boot.

TESTS:

When booting the kernel, watch the boot log text that comes out the serial port get
mirrored to the LCD screen. This is done by adding "115200 console=tty0" to the 
bootargs. Example:
	bootargs = 'console=ttySC2,115200 console=tty0'


If you boot without "console=tty0", you will have to set a video mode before
the LCD will become active. An easy way is to echo one of the supported 'modes' to the
'mode' sysfs file.
Example (setting the LCD to the first mode in the list)
$ cd /sys/devices/platform/fcff7400.display/graphics/fb0/
$ head -1 modes > mode

 LVDS Testing
--------------

== HARDWARE ==
For the RSK Board:
 - CN17: Pins 14 and 15 (CLK +/-) need to be swapped (I modified a cable)
 - Remove R167: (FCE_NAND - NAND Flash)
 - Populate R168: (P5_5_TXOUT1M)
 - Remove R169 (SPDIF_IN - sound)
 - Populate R170 (P5_6_TXOUT0P)
 - Populate R211 (to enable LCD backlight)
 - Remove R182 (P5_7_TXOUT0M) (populated by default)
 - Populate R183 (SPDIF_OUT)(DNF by default)

== SOFTWARE ==
 - Build kerel as uImage
 - In the 'testing' device tree: linux-4.9/arch/arm/boot/dts/r7s72100-rskrza1_testing.dts,
   uncomment the section to enable LVDS.

== USERLAND ==
 - To enable the display, you need to set the 'mode' to one of the options listed in 'modes'
	$ echo U:1280x800p-60 > /sys/devices/platform/fcff9400.display/graphics/fb1/mode
 - Used 'fbv' to display a JPEG on the LVDS dislay (/dev/fb1). You need to set
   "FRAMEBUFFER=/dev/fb1" to tell fbv where to display to.
	$ export FRAMEBUFFER=/dev/fb1
	$ fbv /mnt/mountain-1280x800.jpg
