The following kernel configurations are needed.
	CONFIG_SOUND=y
	CONFIG_SND=y
	CONFIG_SND_SOC=y
	CONFIG_SND_SCUX_RSKRZA1=y


The following Buildroot packages were used for testing:
	[*] alsa-utils
	BR2_PACKAGE_ALSA_UTILS=y

	[*] alsa-utils -> [*] aplay/arecord.
	BR2_PACKAGE_ALSA_UTILS_APLAY=y

	[*] alsactl
	BR2_PACKAGE_ALSA_UTILS_ALSACTL

	[*] alsa-utils -> [*] amixer
	BR2_PACKAGE_ALSA_UTILS_AMIXER=y

	[*] mpg123
	BR2_PACKAGE_MPG123=y

* Playback
	- To play WAV file:
		$ cd sounds
		$ aplay ring.wav
	- To run mp3 file:
		$ mpg123 Richard.mp3

* Record
	- Due to read-only filesystem, it is only possible to record to file at /tmp directory
	- To record audio file:
		$ arecord -f S16_LE -c1 -r44100 -d 50 /tmp/test-mic.wav
	- Play recorded file:
		$ cd /tmp
		$ aplay test-mic.wav
