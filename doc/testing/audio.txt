This testing was done on the RZ/A1H RSK board.


The following kernel configurations are needed.
	CONFIG_SOUND=y
	CONFIG_SND=y
	CONFIG_SND_SOC=y
	CONFIG_SND_SCUX_RSKRZA1=y


The following Buildroot packages were used for testing:
	[*] alsa-utils
	BR2_PACKAGE_ALSA_UTILS=y

	[*] alsa-utils -> [*] aplay/arecord.
	BR2_PACKAGE_ALSA_UTILS_APLAY=y

	[*] alsactl
	BR2_PACKAGE_ALSA_UTILS_ALSACTL

	[*] alsa-utils -> [*] amixer
	BR2_PACKAGE_ALSA_UTILS_AMIXER=y

	[*] mpg123
	BR2_PACKAGE_MPG123=y

Mixer settings
------------------
Before the audio can be used, the audio channels and controls need to be configured correctly.
In this BSP, that is done automatically during system boot in file

	/etc/init.d/S99_rea_setup

and specifically by the line:

	alsactl restore

The 'alsactl restore' commands sets the audio controls according to the file:
	/var/lib/alsa/asound.state

Most importantly, the controls 'SCR0 Control', 'SCR1 Control', 'SSI0 CapControl' and 'SSI0 Control' need to be set to 'On'.
Additionally, the asound.state sets the 'PCM' playback level to 75%, and the 'Capture' level to '75%'
You can use the command 'amixer' to review their current settings.

To manually set these values without using 'alsactrl restore', you would do the following:

amixer cset name="SRC0 Control" 1
amixer cset name="SRC1 Control" 1
amixer cset name="SSI0 CapControl" 1
amixer cset name="SSI0 Control" 1

amixer sset 'Capture',0 75%,75%
amixer sset 'PCM',0 75%,75%

Also, you can set the output volume as follows:

# Set LINE out volume (Left% , Right%)
amixer sset 'Digital Audio Input',0 50%,50%

Testing
------------------
* Playback
	- To play WAV file:
		$ cd sounds
		$ aplay ring.wav
	- To run mp3 file:
		$ mpg123 Richard.mp3

* Record
	- Due to read-only filesystem, it is only possible to record to file at /tmp directory
	- To record audio file:
		$ arecord -f S16_LE -c1 -r44100 -d 50 /tmp/test-mic.wav
	- Play recorded file:
		$ cd /tmp
		$ aplay test-mic.wav



When changing the resistors use to the MIC input instead of LINE IN

# Audio Input Control Registers 'MICL Gain'(0x15) and 'MICL Gain'(0x16)
# Left/Right Microphone Preamplifier Enable
# PAENL: Set from 0x0 (Microphones disabled) -> 0x4 (20dB)
# PAENR: Set from 0x0 (Microphones disabled) -> 0x4 (20dB)
i2cset -f -y 3 0x10 0x15 0x40
i2cset -f -y 3 0x10 0x16 0x40
