The camera interface on the Stream it board was testing by first modifying the board
for 16MB instead of 32MB because of the address pin conflict.

The following options in the kernel needed to be enabled.
     CONFIG_MEDIA_SUPPORT=y
     CONFIG_MEDIA_CAMERA_SUPPORT=y
     CONFIG_V4L_PLATFORM_DRIVERS=y
     CONFIG_VIDEO_RENESAS_CEU=y
     CONFIG_MEDIA_CONTROLLER=y
     CONFIG_VIDEO_V4L2_SUBDEV_API=y
     CONFIG_MEDIA_SUBDRV_AUTOSELECT=n    (NOTE this is =n)
     CONFIG_VIDEO_OV7740=y

The OV7740 camera that comes wtih the stream it was used.

After you boot, you should see the device /dev/video0


The latest version of the yavta program was built (the one in Buildroot was too old)
  $ ./build.sh env
  $ export ROOTDIR=$(pwd) ; source ./setup_env.sh
  $ git clone git://git.ideasonboard.org/yavta.git
  $ cd yavta
  $ make

The command line to capture one frame on the Stream it board was:
  $ yavta /dev/video0 -c1 -n1 -f YUYV -s 640x480 -F"yuyv#.yuv"

After transfering the output file (yuyv000000.yuv) to the PC, ffmpeg was used to convert it to JPEG.

  ffmpeg -f rawvideo -vcodec rawvideo -s 640x480 -pix_fmt yuyv422 -i yuyv000000.yuv yuyv000000.jpg
